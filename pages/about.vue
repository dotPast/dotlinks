    Hey there! I'm dotPast (he/him) (aka. dottt, pasted).<br>
    I'm your average Arch Linux (btw) user and self-taught developer, located in Russia (UTC+3).<br><br>
    This website is made with Nuxt UI and is my replacement for <a class="text-sky-500" href="https://linktr.ee" target="_blank">linktr.ee</a>, <a class="text-sky-500" href="https://solo.to" target="_blank">solo.to</a>, because I can do way more stuff on this page and I don't want to pay for styling.<br>
    Expect random stuff (like blog posts, updates) here. (and eventually a custom domain? would be cool and i won't have dottt.pages.dev url)

    <br><br>oh and <a class="text-sky-500" href="https://twitch.tv/crimrosetv" target="_blank">crimrose</a> has XRay
